                    <h2>Santa Teresa County Park</h2>
                    <p>This diverse 1,673 acre park, rich in history, offers spectacular views from its trails above the Almaden and Santa Clara Valleys. The secluded upland valleys of the park provide a quiet interlude for exploring the natural environment minutes away from the surrounding developed areas.</p>

                    <h2>Hayward Regional Shoreline</h2>
                    <p>Hayward Marsh, completed in 1985, is a 145-acre fresh and brackish water marsh and is somewhat unusual in that it relies on secondary treated effluent as the freshwater source. The marsh is made up of five managed ponds and has 15 islands that are utilized by many species of nesting birds. Flow through the five basins is controlled by a series of weirs, valves, and channels, and allows for great flexibility in operation, management, and biological research.</p>
